# Sample Markdown Document

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Features

- **Easy to read and write:** Markdown files are plain text, which makes them easy to read, even without rendering.
- **Portable:** Markdown can be converted to many other formats, including HTML, PDF, and more.
- **Widely supported:** Many platforms and applications support Markdown.


## Basic Syntax

### Headers

```markdown
# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
```

## Sample Code in Markdown

You can include code snippets in Markdown using fenced code blocks. Here's an example in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    This function greets the user with the given name.
    """
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    
# Example usage
greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```
